Description
-----------

Command-line program to generate, update or transform docstrings python
source code.

The app will parse the requested source files for docstrings as well as
function signatures and class bodies.

This information is combined to build up complete docstrings for every
function and class including place holders for types and descriptions
where none could be found elsewhere.

The output format of the docstrings can be chosen between google, numpy,
reST and epydoc. This means that the tool can also be used to transform
docstrings in the file from one format into another.

Note however that not all section types are supported for all docstring
styles.

Partially because they have not been added yet, but also because not
every style officially supports the sections from all others.

To get further information please refer to the
`documentation <https://pymend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`__.

The tool offers the choice between generating patch files or directly
overwriting the python source files.

Start quickly
-------------

-  install from PyPi

.. code:: sh

   $ pip install pymend

-  install from sources:

.. code:: sh

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/JanEricNitschke/pymend.git
   or
   $ git clone https://github.com/JanEricNitschke/pymend.git
   $ cd pymend
   $ python setup.py install

-  run from the command line:

.. code:: sh

   $ pymend  myfile.py    # will generate a patch
   $ pymend -w myfile.py  # will overwrite the file

or

.. code:: sh

   $ pymend  my/folder/

-  get help:

.. code:: sh

   $ pymend -h

Example
-------

To see how pymend looks in action lets consider this example file `example.py`:

.. code-block:: python

   """_summary_."""
    def my_func(param0, param01: int, param1: str = "Some value", param2: List[str] = {}):
        """_summary_.

        Args:
            param0 (_type_): _description_
            param01 (int): _description_
            param1 (str, optional): _description_. Defaults to "Some value".
            param2 (List[str], optional): _description_. Defaults to {}.
        """
        pass


    def my_single_return_func1() -> str:
        """_summary_.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Wrong
        """
        pass


    def my_multi_return_func() -> Tuple[int, str, bool]:
        """_summary_.

        Returns
        -------
        x :
            Some integer
        y : str
            Some string
        z : bool
            Some bool
        """
        pass

   class A:
      def method(self, param1, param2=None) -> int:
            pass

Now let's use Pyment:

.. code-block:: sh

        $ pyment example.py

This produces the following patch file `example.py.patch`:

.. code-block:: patch

Calling pyment directly with

.. code-block:: sh

        $ pyment --write example.py

print outs this information about changed files

-- code-block: sh

     $ Modified docstrings of elements (my_func, my_single_return_func1, my_multi_return_func, A, method) in file example.py.

and results in the final file (the same we would have gotten when applying the patch):

.. code-block:: python

      """_summary_."""
      def my_func(param0, param01: int, param1: str = "Some value", param2: List[str] = {}):

Pre-commit
----------

To use pymend in a `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ hook just
add the following to your ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``

.. code:: yaml

   repos:
   -   repo: https://github.com/JanEricNitschke/pymend
       rev: "v1.0.0"
       hooks:
       -   id: pymend
           language: python
           args: ["--write", "--output=numpydoc"]

Acknowledgements
----------------

This project was inspired by and is originally based upon
`pyment <https://github.com/dadadel/pyment/>`__. The intended
functionality as well as the main entry point remain largerly unchanged.
However additional functionality has been added in the form of ast
traversal for extracting function and class information.

The docstring parsing has been replaced completely with code taken from
the awesome
`docstring_parser <https://github.com/rr-/docstring_parser>`__ project,
specifically `this
fork <https://github.com/jsh9/docstring_parser_fork>`__.

So far only minor modifications have been made to the docstring parsing
functionality. Mainly the addition of the “Methods” section for numpydoc
style docstrings. Additionally the the code has been linted as well as
type hinted.
